- I wrote this script because I wanted a "Library" equivalent in Spotify, like how it is in Apple Music.  In Apple Music any song that is liked or added to a playlist is added to "Library", acting as a sort of  "Master Playlist" of sorts. There was nothing similar to this in Spotify, where it is automatically added to a playlist. 
-  Used [spotipy](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.22.1/), lightweight library for Spotify API in Python
